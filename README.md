# as-zellij

This is an experiment to create a Zellij plugin system for AssemblyScript. It currently implements a small subset of the features from the official Rust API: https://docs.rs/zellij-tile/latest/zellij_tile/.

See https://github.com/bendiksolheim/zellij-js-plugin for an example plugin using this framework.
